# GA Project 4 - MER(React Native)N Stack

# Ameliorate Application

## Background

This mobile app is motivated by the recent Greenridge Crescent incident, where a father was suspected (later arrested) to be involved in the death of his two 11-year-old sons. At the point of time where this project idea was form, it was rumored that these 2 children were twins with special needs.

Like how spiderman is known as your Friendly Neighborhood who protects people from villians, **Ameliorate** hopes to be your Neighborhood Guardian who will help you fight (yours or other's) inner demons or take care of your mental well-being.

## Description

**Ameliorate** aims to:

- allow people(user) who are at their most vulnerable moments of their life to reach out to someone who can help them at their finger tips
- users can submit (and edit) a form which will provide social workers with helpful details
- the app can track users' location in the foreground and background, any change in their locations will trigger an update to the database
- in any case where users decide that they do not require help any longer, they can cancel their requests
- an admin can see all the users on the map represented by location pins
- the location pins are color coded according to users' level of safety, which will allow social worker to quickly identify where help is of higher priority (red in color)
- upon successful rendering of help, the admin can close the case with the 'close case' button and the particular user's pin will no longer be shown in the map
